Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science (2024â€“2026) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with a research focus on AI security, deep learning, and natural language processing. I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati (2020).

My work centers on enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and generalization of machine learning models. Iâ€™ve contributed to projects involving backdoor defenses, model ensembling, and large-scale zero-shot classification, spanning both NLP and computer vision domains.

Professionally, Iâ€™ve worked with research and development teams at University College London and MAQ Software, where I gained hands-on experience with LLM-based systems, scalable AI pipelines, and adversarial threat mitigation. Iâ€™ve also collaborated with researchers at Google DeepMind. My work has been published at venues like ACL and supported by competitive awards such as the DAAD-WISE Scholarship.
