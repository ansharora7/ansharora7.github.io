I am a Master’s student in Computer Science (2024–2026) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where my research spans AI security, robust machine learning, and deep learning, with interests across natural language processing and computer vision. I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati.

My work focuses on improving the robustness, efficiency, and generalization of machine learning systems. I have contributed to research on backdoor defenses, model ensembling, large-scale zero-shot classification, and secure biometric recognition, combining insights from NLP and vision.

I have worked with research and development teams at Thales (Identity & Biometrics R&D), University College London, and MAQ Software, and have collaborated with researchers at Google DeepMind. My research has been published at venues such as ACL, contributed to multiple patent filings in biometric systems, and supported by competitive awards including the DAAD-WISE Scholarship.
