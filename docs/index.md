I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science (2024–2026) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with a research focus on AI security, deep learning, and zero-shot learning. I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati (2020).

My work centers on enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and generalization of machine learning models. I’ve contributed to projects involving backdoor defenses, model ensembling, and large-scale zero-shot classification, spanning both NLP and computer vision domains.

Professionally, I’ve worked with research and development teams at University College London and MAQ Software, where I gained hands-on experience with LLM-based systems, scalable AI pipelines, and adversarial threat mitigation. I’ve also collaborated with researchers at Google DeepMind. My work has been published at venues like ACL and supported by competitive awards such as the DAAD-WISE Scholarship.

This site includes my [CV](/assets/files/CV.pdf), a list of [publications](/publications), and [news](/news) about ongoing projects and recent updates.
